# Phases represent collections of commands that are executed during your test run on the test host.
phases:

  # The install phase contains commands for installing dependencies to run your tests.
  # For your convenience, certain dependencies are preinstalled on the test host.

  # For iOS tests, you can use the Python tools pyenv and pip to setup your environment, as well as
  # Node.JS tools nvm, npm, and avm to setup your Appium server. By default, Python versions 3.10
  # and 3.7 are available on the test host.

      # The Appium server is written using Node.js. In order to run your desired version of Appium,
      # you first need to set up a Node.js environment that is compatible with your version of Appium.
      # For iOS, use "nvm use" to switch between the two preinstalled NodeJS versions 14 and 16, and
      # use "nvm install" to download a new version of your choice.

      # NodeJS version 16 and above.
