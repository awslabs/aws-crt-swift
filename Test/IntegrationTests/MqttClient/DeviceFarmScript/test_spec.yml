# These default test spec file commands assume that the test package has been built in accordance
# with the instructions in AWS Device Farm's documentation for testing with Appium Python:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/test-types-appium.html

# Note that iOS 17 and above devices use a test host with an Apple silicon CPU, whereas
# iOS 16 and below devices use a test host with an Intel CPU.

# Phases represent collections of commands that are executed during your test run on the test host.
phases:

  # The install phase contains commands for installing dependencies to run your tests.
  # For your convenience, certain dependencies are preinstalled on the test host.

  # For iOS tests, you can use the Python tools pyenv and pip to setup your environment, as well as
  # Node.JS tools nvm, npm, and avm to setup your Appium server. By default, Python versions 3.10
  # and 3.7 are available on the test host.
  install:
    commands:
      # The Appium server is written using Node.js. In order to run your desired version of Appium,
      # you first need to set up a Node.js environment that is compatible with your version of Appium.
      # For iOS, use "nvm use" to switch between the two preinstalled NodeJS versions 14 and 16, and
      # use "nvm install" to download a new version of your choice.

      # For iOS, Appium versions 1.22.2 and 2.2.1 are preinstalled and selectable through avm.
      # For all other versions, please use npm to install them. For example:
      # - npm install -g appium@2.1.3;
      # Note that, for iOS devices, Appium 2 is only supported on iOS version 14 and above using
      # NodeJS version 16 and above.

      # For Appium version 2, for iOS tests, the XCUITest driver is preinstalled using version 5.7.0
      # If you want to install a different version of the driver, you can use the Appium extension CLI
